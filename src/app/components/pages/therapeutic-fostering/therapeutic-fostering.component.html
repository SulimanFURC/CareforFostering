                    Therapeutic fostering is sometimes called therapeutically-led care or TLC for short. National
                    Fostering Group offers this specialised training for our foster carers.

                    <p class="text-white text-space-size">
                        TLC is a response that recognises some foster children need to be looked after by foster carers
                        who have a specific set of skills because they’ve experienced trauma and abuse at a young age.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white text-space-size">
                        Therapeutic fostering teachers foster carers to respond in the best possible way to individual
                        children to enable them to feel safe and to grow.

                        In addition to all of the usual benefits of fostering, therapeutic fostering incorporates
                        additional therapy for young people who have had an especially difficult start in life. The aim
                        is to help them to feel safe and begin learning to trust adults again so they can recover.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white text-space-size">
                        Imagine working with some of the most vulnerable and traumatised children in society and helping
                        to guide them gently back to a sense of trust and security through your compassionate and
                        consistent care.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white text-space-size">
                        And imagine seeing those children begin to find their way in life and lay the foundations for an
                        incredible future.

                        We use the term “wraparound support” in relation to therapeutic fostering. This means that, when
                        you become a foster carer for very vulnerable children, you will receive:

                        assessment and training in this area.
