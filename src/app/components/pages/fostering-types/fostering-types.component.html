                                        Parents sometimes need a little bit of extra help caring for their children. We
                                        need foster carers to be on hand to help develop the parents’ skills whilst they
                                        learn from you. These type of foster care are typically 12 weeks long but may
                                        last longer.

                                        Bridging is a type of short-term foster care which takes place when babies or
                                        very young children need a temporary home before moving on to somewhere more
                                        permanent. You may be asked to provide foster care on a short-term basis as we
                                        prepare to move children back with their birth family or find long-term care or
                                        forever homes through adoption.

                                        Sometimes the best solution is for the child to remain with a foster family for
                                        several years or up until they are ready to take care of themselves, which is
                                        where long-term foster care comes in. More often than not, the child will become
                                        a firm member of your family for the rest of your life.

                                        As you might expect, this is a demanding role with a lot of responsibility. It’s
                                        a highly specialised role for an experienced foster carer who might have
                                        additional skills and training. We recommend you consider being available to
                                        foster young children of other ages too.

                                        Children in emergency foster care might have additional needs. They could
                                        display challenging behaviours that need addressing, or have physical or
                                        learning disabilities that require specialist skills. They might be babies who

                                        Marie and Carol arrived at their foster carers as emergency foster care for
                                        siblings. The eldest, Marie, was timid and pale, whereas her younger sister
                                        Carol was more chatty. They showed violence towards each other and swore a lot.
                                        Their school attendance was poor.

                                        Both girls were underweight and knew little about personal hygiene. They arrived

                                        carers showed them patience, affection and discipline, and the girls transformed
                                        as they learned how to thrive in their new home. They have been with the same

                                        This assessment is officially called a Form F. It is completed by your assessing

                                        outlines the basis of your suitability to be a foster carer with National
                                        Fostering Group, and
                                        details all your skills and experiences.

                                        In short, we work alongside you to document the reasons why your home would be a
                                        positive
                                        environment for children and young people to live in, and why you would make a
                                        great foster parent.

                                        During the assessment stage your assessing social worker will make regular
                                        planned visits over a
                                        period of eight to ten weeks to both share and gather information.

                                        This stage of the assessment is a great opportunity for you to learn more about
                                        the role of a foster
                                        carer. This is just as important we us getting to know more about you and your
                                        family members, who
                                        will play a pivotal role in a foster child or young person’s care.

                                        All applicants require a medical check at their local GP, all costs of this are

                                        are fit and able to look after children. Your previous medical history will not

                                        GP will simply give us recommendations and let us know of any barriers that may
